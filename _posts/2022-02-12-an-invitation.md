Welcome to a memory hole.

## It Begins

I was chatting with some friends, all of whom have some level of association with the "ex-vangelical" movement. I'll try to dive into what this all means at some point in this project, but what you need to know is that we were all part of the evangelical church and now consider part of ourselves no longer part of that and are re-evaluating the culture and values of that particular movement.

Part of our discussion that night led to us giving our "hot takes" on faith, and I said that the _Left Behind_ series of books had done serious damage to the evangelical church's perception of Revelation and the circle just stared at me. No one had heard of the series.

I'm all of a few years older than the median age of this friend group and it was as though this book series I remember being _everywhere_ at a particular moment in time for the church had vaporized into thin air.

That moment stuck with me for a few weeks. I remember these books being everywhere through my middle school and high school experience, and any time I've visited home the local Goodwills and used bookstores are lousy with copies. Maybe it was just a midwest thing, but maybe this whole wing of things has been collectively memory-holed as newer, shinier trends have taken hold in the neverending culture wars.

I've joked for a few years off and on that I was going to start a project to re-read these with fresh eyes. Generally this has been in tandem with a goofy conceptual framework like "I am only allowed to get each book in the series from a Goodwill in the Midwest". But I think I'm _actually_ going to do it this time.

## How this will work

I am a fast reader. When I say this, I mean that I set a reading goal of 100 books a year and generally hit that marker by some time in September. Removing that conceptual framework (though trying to buy these in softcover at deep discount/Goodwill prices wherever possible), I think that at a book a month, I can go through the main part of the Left Behind series in a year and a half.

I'll check in every two weeks with where things are at, what I'm reflecting on, and where this reading is taking my thinking.

Thinking about this series made me think of some other books from that particular part of my development I remember devouring. We'll throw those in the mix as well.

Here's to a new project. Hope you enjoy the ride.
