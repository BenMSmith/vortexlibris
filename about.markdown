Vortex Libris is a project by [Ben Smith](http://goodatinter.net) where the author revisits 90s contemporary Christian ephemera from an exvangelical lens.

## Why Vortex Libris?

I picked this domain up after we decided to not use it for Mystery Hunt 2022, since I liked it. Given that I'm dealing with memory-holed literature, something riffing on both "vortex" and "ex libris" felt nice.
